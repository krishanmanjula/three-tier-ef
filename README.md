Certainly! Here is an overview of how to implement a 3-tier architecture project using Entity Framework (EF) with the code-first approach.

# Overview of 3-Tier Architecture

The 3-tier architecture is a software design pattern that organizes applications into three distinct layers: Presentation, Business Logic, and Data Access. This separation enhances modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

# Layers:
1.Presentation Layer: Handles the UI or API, interacts with the user.

2.Business Logic Layer: Contains the core functionality and business rules.

3.Data Access Layer: Manages data storage and retrieval, typically interacts with databases.

## Implementation with Entity Framework Code-First

Create a Solution with Three Projects:

Presentation Layer (e.g., ASP.NET Core Web API or MVC)
Business Logic Layer (Class Library)
Data Access Layer (Class Library)
Add References:

The Presentation Layer references the Business Logic Layer.
The Business Logic Layer references the Data Access Layer.

This layer will use Entity Framework to handle data operations.


Run the following command in the DataAccessLayer project

dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
